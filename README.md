This plugin is focused on testing local code within [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/), based on the [@shoelace](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace) `code-block` implementation. Unlike other [docsify plugins](https://docsify.js.org/#/plugins) that exist, this plugin supports LitElement, more recently known as [Lit.Dev](https://lit.dev/). Similar to Storybook, this allows for testing common use cases, but in a simpler way.

**Key Features**
- A live preview of your component/s, which can be resized to emulate smaller devices
- Each demo comes with a toggleable code view, which reveals the underlying code
- For all the code previews, this plugin integrates a copy button feature

This is my first plugin - please feel welcome to suggest features or raise bugs by creating an issue.

## Installation

1. Add the jsdelivr script
```html
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify-demo@1.0.0/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```

2. Add the jsdelivr styles
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify-demo@1.0.0/dist/index.min.css">
```

3. Use the following markdown to add a component to your documentation
```html
    ```html preview
    <p> Hello, World. </p>
    ```
```

4. This is what it should look like
